# form-input
This is a learning project is intended to process a user input data into the form (a name and an age).

# How it works
A user can input data into the form: Name and Age. After submitting the form, it adds a user to the list below the form.
Also, here there is a validation of user input data. When a user submits an empty form, opens a modal window notifying about it. When a user submits a form with Age field data as a negative number, it shows a modal with a message about the invalid age data. To close a modal window where error is displayed, a user needs to click outside of the modal window or on the ‘okay’ button.
